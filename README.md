This is an assignment for my Multivariate Statistical Analysis 1 course.

**Description**  
Testing variables for multicollinearity, multivariate normality and analyzing outliers and missing values.

- Multicollinearity test
- Missing value analysis
- Outlier analysis
- Multivariate normality tests
- Variable transformation (Log)
  
**Data Set**  
Everybody was randomly assigned with 8 variables.  
I created a version with missing variables for the 3rd task.

Both data sets are available [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fOYxTTSah03dd51eyOtGEridhT6ajspF/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=101335653601487878661&rtpof=true&sd=true).
